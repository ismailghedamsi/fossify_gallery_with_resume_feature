# Fossify Gallery – Resume Edition (Fork)

This project is a lightweight fork of the excellent Fossify Gallery. Original project: https://github.com/FossifyOrg/Gallery

It keeps the privacy‑first, open‑source spirit while adding a few focused enhancements for faster everyday use.

## What’s unique in this fork
- Auto‑resume last seen image
  - On app launch, automatically opens the last photo you viewed in its folder.
  - Persists when you enter the viewer, swipe, and on viewer resume.
- Smart next‑folder advance
- Quick slideshow button
  - One‑tap start from the bottom action bar, no dialog.
  - Default interval: 3 seconds (configurable in Settings → Slideshow).
- Back‑stack polish
  - From a resumed image: Back → folder grid, Back again → all folders.

## Core features (from the original)
- Private by design: no ads, minimal permissions.
- Built‑in editor: crop, resize, rotate, flip, draw, filters.
- Recycle bin for easy restore.
- Flexible UI: themes, layout options, and bottom actions.
- Wide format support: images (JPEG, JPG XL, PNG, RAW, SVG, GIF, AVIF, …) and videos (MP4, MKV, …).
- Clean Material styling with dynamic themes.

## Install
Build with Gradle as usual. Package name is different, so it can be installed alongside the original.

## Credits
All credit for the base app goes to the Fossify team and contributors: https://github.com/FossifyOrg/Gallery

This fork only adds the resume/next‑folder/slideshow improvements and small UX tweaks.
